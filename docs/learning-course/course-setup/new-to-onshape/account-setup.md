Onshape will proceed to check your information (which may take some time), then send a verification email to activate your account. You'll be asked to set a password, then you'll enter your dashboard.

### Account Setup

The first time you enter Onshape, it will prompt you to set up your account, including the default units and mouse controls used when doing CAD. Please use your real name when prompted. The default units should be adjusted from the defaults to be metric. The image below shows the units you should choose. Notice that millimetres (mm) are used instead of centimetres (cm). You may be more familiar with centimetres, but millimetres are the preferred engineering unit. If you need to change your default units after creating an account, you can do this by clicking on your name in the top right, selecting "My account", opening "Preferences" on the left side bar, and scrolling until you see the units settings.

### Join the Onshape Team

Once you have successfully logged in to Onshape, talk to a lead mentor to get added to the 4788 Onshape Team. Once you are added, you can access the team files from the left sidebar on the "Documents" page, under the "Teams" dropdown.
